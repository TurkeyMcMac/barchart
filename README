HISTOGRAM
=========

This program makes histograms. For example, take this file 'data':

33 This is a label
 0 This is another
100
80 The line above had no label  

Running './histogram -w 80 data' would produce:

 33 This is a label             ################
  0 This is another             
100                             ################################################
 80 The line above had no label #######################################

The script should work with any POSIX shell. However, it can only automatically
detect terminal width if the 'tput' command is present.

This script integrates well into pipelines. For example, this makes a histogram
of line counts for all source files in 'src':

find -L src -type f -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -rn | histogram | less
