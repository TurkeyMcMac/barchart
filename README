HISTOGRAM
=========

This program makes histograms. For example, take this file 'data':

33 This is a label
 0 This is another
100
80 The line above had no label  

Running './histogram -w 80 data' would produce:

 33 This is a label             ################
  0 This is another             
100                             ################################################
 80 The line above had no label #######################################

The script should work with any POSIX shell. However, it can only automatically
detect terminal width if the 'tput' command is present.
